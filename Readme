Bamazon is Amazon-like storefront. It takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

The app would first display all the products in Node with item IDs, product name, price and quantity available.
Then it will prompt 2 questions:

1. The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
2. The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, the application would check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app would log the phrase Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.

However, if the store does have enough of the product, it will fulfill the customer's order and log the total amount due.
Once the customer's order is fulfilled it will update the quantity in Mysql Database
